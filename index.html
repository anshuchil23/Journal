                Why do people like balloons? Would they still like then m if they were black and white or weird shaped or
                not bound by a string

                I saw this really old lady on the street.she was taking a photograph of something on the road. I didn't turn
                around to see what it was I just saw the lady. She took the picture and simply stared at her camera,
                smiling. I felt that smile. There was a hint of pride. And just utter pure euphoria painted across her face.
                It made me want to cry. But I smiled instead

                Its been a few months since I've had this feeling that nothing is real and I'm living a dream. Not in a
                romantic sense at all. However off late I've been feeling more comfortable with my state of mind. Is it that
                the feeling is going away? Or is it that I'm coming to terms with the truth of the feeling?

                I think I'm feeling anger right now. I feel like bursting out and screaming, but my body doesn't really want
                to. Is the reason why I don't express anger is because my body resists?

                Perhaps if I focus more on what I have to do rather than the nature of things, then I can live the lie of
                reality to its fullest

                Isn't it funny how humans can sit and talk about the nature of their ways

                It's interesting how people in high rise apartment balconies tend to look down more than they will up. Is it
                because they feel power over then who are down. Is it because they feel pressured to appreciate the beauty
                of earth and not hope for the heavens. Is it because looking up can only be done from down below

                It's weird how I haven't written about this before. I thought I had. Perhaps I was mistaken. Or maybe I
                convinced myself that I had mentally. Who knows. Anyways. Ive moved back and forth between two countries for
                most of my life. Stayed in Dubai(I know it's a city) till I was 6 or 7. Moved to bombay and stayed there
                till I was 16. Moved back to Dubai and stayed there till I was 18. I then moved to New York. I feel like
                somehow Everytime I moved it was a form of complete detachment from the person I was at the time. It didn't
                feel so at the time and I obviously carried on living so I wasn't a new person. But it felt like I was
                moving on. Except for Bombay to Dubai. That was hard because I think I started opening up to people in the
                year I was to move and was even in a relationship.the decision to move was hard indeed. A year in Dubai felt
                like I was in a limbo. Neither here nor there. All of these circumstances have probably contributed to my
                current headspace wherein I don't necessarily think I am strongly attached to anything. If that thing were
                to vanish the very next moment. I don't think I will feel very much sadness. Is that a good thing or a bad
                thing? There's not really one answer I guess. Maybe I am the Buddha lmao.
                I just saw a guy who stopped his bike in the middle of the flyover to take a picture of a newspaper ad with
                a digital fucking camera. Not even a phone camera. He had his helmet on. What a character

                I'm at my goregaon house rn. It's a bit weird for me. Seeing the house I probably spent the most time in all
                dusty and unused. It used to be a family of 7 that loved in this house. What makes it weirder though is the
                furniture from my Dubai house that has been shifted in here and stored. Aside from all the boxes full of my
                stuff, the furniture makes it seem almost like a dreamscape made from all my memories from the past 19 years

                Time doesn't exist in dreams

                Episode 82 of Naruto Shippuden has to be one of the best episodes of Naruto yet. Fucking beautiful. It deals
                with the loss of asuma. Different ways of grieving. Shikamarus character is explored. Just loved this
                episode.

                The beating of a card wind shield wipers are so much like the cars very own heartbeat. A similar frequency
                and rhythm. It's pretty cool of you think about cars as separate living creatures. Us their gods. Their will
                driven by ours

                I had a dream. I cried myself to sleep after a really long time. I wish I cried more often.
            </p>
            <p class="element element4">
                I'm glad I cried last night. I had a weird dream about aliens and cats. Weird mini aliens had infiltrated
                earth without us knowing and my cat was one of them. My greyish white cat with greyish black patches. The
                entire story in my dream revolves around my cat. It explored aliens and my discoveries about them, but my
                cat was always in frame. When my cat was revealed to be an alien who had completed her mission and had to
                leave to join her alien forces again, I wasnt the only one heartbroken. I didn't want my cat to leave me.
                And I accepted her as her alien form. She turned into a beautiful alien. I could've dealt with that. She
                didn't want to leave either. I could see regret in her eyes as she left me. I could see that she didn't want
                to leave. She never said it but I could tell. I can't remember the details but she ended up leaving. And
                before leaving there was a moment where I told myself that I wouldn't forget her. Fast forward. I wake up to
                reality(?). In the center of my black pillow lies one single strand of white hair. I take a moment to figure
                out whose hair it is. My roommate doesn't have white hair. I don't. None of my friends do. I'd like to
                believe it was my cat. I don't even know if my cat had a name. I can't remember. But I remember the picture
                in my head. I remember what my cat looked like. And I'll remember her essence. I told myself that I would
                remember her. And I will.

                Which shoulder of mine did you lay your head upon. Which cheek of mine had you kissed. It seemed wrong of me
                to remember and it feels wrong for me to forget.

                It's funny how I don't really have a single phone number. None of them are constant phone numbers of mine.

                I don't use a single one for more than 6 months at a stretch.

                I think I'm actually empty on the inside. I think that's the issue with why I feel out of tune. I was
                emptied of character somewhere along the line and now I'm empty. I display these emotions but it's all the
                outermost thinnest shell. I'm hollow on the inside. This is probably why I don't feel attached to anything
                in this world. Did I empty myself of feeling in order to move on? Didn't I pride myself on the philosophy of
                pure emotion? This is is kind of ironic. Will I come to accept this revelation somewhere down the line or
                will I feel the muscle fat and meat inside of me once again. Will I feel like my insides exist? Who knows
                lol

                My tea doesn't taste the same anymore. Kinda sounds like a metaphor lol
            </p>

                I feel like I'm becoming dependent on coffee and I hate it. Fuck.

                I'm writing this now because I'm not really feeling any strong emotion. Most of what I've written previously
                has been the output of strong emotion which is truly enjoy. This entry however is just plain and sprouts
                from nothing. I think there's beauty in this too. Why should emotion trigger artistic response. Everybody
                has moments when they're not feeling anything and this is to appreciate that

                I've been feel extremely lovesick these past few weeks. Human intimacy triggers my want for more. I feel
                lonely I suppose. That's been my everlasting state for a while. I also. Feel really warm right now. Like Im
                being loved at this very moment, but I'm alone. Maybe it's the weed in my head and coffee in my hands but I
                feel really nice. Hopeful, yet a hint of sadness that makes me feel grateful for being alive

                I just had a breakdown. For no reason. I was feeling down the whole day. Again idk why. I was so happy with
                how my semester went and the people I've met in these past few months. But I just bawled me eyes out not
                even knowing why. I kept asking myself why I'm crying but I had no answer. Is this normal. I can't remember
                if this has happened before. I think it has. But I'm not sure. Wtf is wrong with me. I'm crying while
                writing this. I still don't know why

                Narration in a book is the same as music in a book's movie adaptation.

                Bombay feels like someone went and built a whole ass city in the center of a jungle in under a day and told
                all the residents of the jungle "this is your home now" and everyone was like "yeah cool".

                When sitting at the front of a class does one forget that the class behind them exists. The person sitting
                at the back however is constantly aware of the whole class

                If you destroy something made using child labor are you destroying all of their hardwork. Did they work for
                nothing

                If you were made of fire, you would be feeling cold every moment of your life.

                I just showed my friends a news article I got from this news app inshorts. The article wasn't at all
                relevant and I'm just really high so I thought showing them a random thing would be funny. The thing I
                realized is that they didn't understand the article at all. It read, "world cup's fastest hundred, biggest
                run chase came in same match." I could understand it because I was indian and had the basic understanding of
                cricket that comes with being indian. It's fascinating that they couldn't read and understand the same news
                article that I read and understood even though it was in proper English. It's because they have different
                backgrounds that's wild.
            </p>
            <p class="element element9">I just woke up from a crazy ass dream. It's funny actually cause I don't even remember the dream. I just
                remember that it was a really cool journey and I was living a different life as a different person. I was in
                a different world. I was enjoying it. I think. What's crazy is. The only thing I remember was the last thing
                that happened. A familiar face and voice from the journey was speaking to me. It said ' and I'm sorry but
                this is how this is going to end '. And as soon as they said that, my alarm started to go off in the real
                world, and I woke up here. Fkn mad.

                So corona is happening. I'm living in a pandemic Bois. Everything feels so unreal. So surreal. Countries in
                fear. Borders closed. People in fear. Stores closed. I feel like all the displacement in my life has led to
                this climax. I'm being kicked out of my dorm. I was kicked out from loeb hall last year. But this time it's
                because the school is scared. Scared of this virus. As everyone should be im sure. But they've given us 4
                days to move out of this dorm. Never have I felt so displaced. So unwanted. This was a reminder that we're
                all living under the mercy of someone else. Someone more powerful. But more so than that, this 'crisis' has
                made me realize that I don't really belong anywhere. Should I go to India. Should I find an apartment in
                NYC. Should I go to Philly. Dubai isn't an option I suppose. I just do not know where I belong and where I
                should go. I'm an alien. To all places. What is my identity. What is my home.


                It's been a while. Idk if it was the dishes I was doing or the rain that was screaming through the mosquito
                net of the window next to me. There's supposed to be a cyclone tomorrow. Or today. I don't really know the
                difference anymore. Is that a bad thing? Who knows? I haven't written here in a really long time. Feels that
                way at least. Especially considering all the stuff that's happened to me since I last wrote.
                Corona is still happening. I'm in Bombay rn.
            </p>
            <p class="element element10">At home with my family. It's weird. Everything that wasn't bombay feels like… a fever dream. It feels like
                I've just woken up into this reality. Everything feels off. But not too bad tbh. I'm not in a bad state
                right now. It was pretty bad when school was still on- online school lmao. I just lost all motivation to do
                anything. I haven't coded in so long, I wasn't learning anything. I felt useless and was being useless. I
                began to draw during classes. Put my video off, audio off, ipad on and was sketching. I've posted more than
                I ever have on my art page on instagram. Idek if that's an accomplishment. This period of my life feels like
                those scenes from movies where the main character enters a white room where they are supposed to confront
                all that they think is bad about themselves and only then can they be released back into reality. It's a
                struggle. But i also feel guilt. I have the privilege to have this struggle. Right now especially, more than
                ever, my privilege is being shoved in my face. Super cyclones, locust swarms, the biggest fucking migrant
                crisis and now some of the biggest riots the United States has ever seen. I saw a video of a policeman
                pulling a gun out on the crowd just around my old dorm. Shits unreal. There's struggle happening all around
                the world at this very moment and I'm here in my high rise apartment writing this on my phone. Everything
                feels just off. I haven't been outdoors ever since I landed. Idk if that's affected me at all tbh. I feel
                the same. It feels like yesterday that I landed in bombay but in realiy its been like 4 months. What the
                fuck. I feel my depersonalization syndrome knocking on my mind's door every other minute. But he's like my
                best friend now so it's chill. He's like my toxic friend who you know is toxic but you also care about.
                Lmao. I've just been drawing non stop. Part of me likes it. And part of me hates it. That's been my
                disposition off late. That duality. And this has been a long ass entry. Okay um. 2020 recap- Australian
                wildfires, climate change, indo pakistan cold war, us Afghanistan and Iraq??? War, world war three threats,
                a fucking pandemic, super cyclones in india, murder of george floyd causing the biggest riots in America,
                I'm sure there's more but I'm tired and don't feel like googling it.
                We're barely halfway through this year and it's been a fucking trip. I wanna smoke.
