            Why do people like balloons? Would they still like then m if they were black and white or weird shaped or
            not bound by a string

            I saw this really old lady on the street.she was taking a photograph of something on the road. I didn't turn
            around to see what it was I just saw the lady. She took the picture and simply stared at her camera,
            smiling. I felt that smile. There was a hint of pride. And just utter pure euphoria painted across her face.
            It made me want to cry. But I smiled instead

            Its been a few months since I've had this feeling that nothing is real and I'm living a dream. Not in a
            romantic sense at all. However off late I've been feeling more comfortable with my state of mind. Is it that
            the feeling is going away? Or is it that I'm coming to terms with the truth of the feeling?

            I think I'm feeling anger right now. I feel like bursting out and screaming, but my body doesn't really want
            to. Is the reason why I don't express anger is because my body resists?

            Perhaps if I focus more on what I have to do rather than the nature of things, then I can live the lie of
            reality to its fullest

            Isn't it funny how humans can sit and talk about the nature of their ways </div>

        <div class= "element element2">It's interesting how people in high rise apartment balconies tend to look down more than they will up. Is it
            because they feel power over then who are down. Is it because they feel pressured to appreciate the beauty
            of earth and not hope for the heavens. Is it because looking up can only be done from down below

            It's weird how I haven't written about this before. I thought I had. Perhaps I was mistaken. Or maybe I
            convinced myself that I had mentally. Who knows. Anyways. Ive moved back and forth between two countries for
            most of my life. Stayed in Dubai(I know it's a city) till I was 6 or 7. Moved to bombay and stayed there
            till I was 16. Moved back to Dubai and stayed there till I was 18. I then moved to New York. I feel like
            somehow Everytime I moved it was a form of complete detachment from the person I was at the time. It didn't
            feel so at the time and I obviously carried on living so I wasn't a new person. But it felt like I was
            moving on. Except for Bombay to Dubai. That was hard because I think I started opening up to people in the
            year I was to move and was even in a relationship.the decision to move was hard indeed. A year in Dubai felt
            like I was in a limbo. Neither here nor there. All of these circumstances have probably contributed to my
            current headspace wherein I don't necessarily think I am strongly attached to anything. If that thing were
            to vanish the very next moment. I don't think I will feel very much sadness. Is that a good thing or a bad
            thing? There's not really one answer I guess. Maybe I am the Buddha lmao.
            I just saw a guy who stopped his bike in the middle of the flyover to take a picture of a newspaper ad with
            a digital fucking camera. Not even a phone camera. He had his helmet on. What a character

            I'm at my goregaon house rn. It's a bit weird for me. Seeing the house I probably spent the most time in all
            dusty and unused. It used to be a family of 7 that loved in this house. What makes it weirder though is the
            furniture from my Dubai house that has been shifted in here and stored. Aside from all the boxes full of my
            stuff, the furniture makes it seem almost like a dreamscape made from all my memories from the past 19 years

            Time doesn't exist in dreams</div>

        <div class= "element element3">Episode 82 of Naruto Shippuden has to be one of the best episodes of Naruto yet. Fucking beautiful. It deals
            with the loss of asuma. Different ways of grieving. Shikamarus character is explored. Just loved this
            episode.

            The beating of a card wind shield wipers are so much like the cars very own heartbeat. A similar frequency
            and rhythm. It's pretty cool of you think about cars as separate living creatures. Us their gods. Their will
            driven by ours

            I had a dream. I cried myself to sleep after a really long time. I wish I cried more often.</div>
        <div class= "element element4"> I'm glad I cried last night. I had a weird dream about aliens and cats. Weird mini aliens had infiltrated
            earth without us knowing and my cat was one of them. My greyish white cat with greyish black patches. The
            entire story in my dream revolves around my cat. It explored aliens and my discoveries about them, but my
            cat was always in frame. When my cat was revealed to be an alien who had completed her mission and had to
            leave to join her alien forces again, I wasnt the only one heartbroken. I didn't want my cat to leave me.
            And I accepted her as her alien form. She turned into a beautiful alien. I could've dealt with that. She
            didn't want to leave either. I could see regret in her eyes as she left me. I could see that she didn't want
            to leave. She never said it but I could tell. I can't remember the details but she ended up leaving. And
            before leaving there was a moment where I told myself that I wouldn't forget her. Fast forward. I wake up to
            reality(?). In the center of my black pillow lies one single strand of white hair. I take a moment to figure
            out whose hair it is. My roommate doesn't have white hair. I don't. None of my friends do. I'd like to
            believe it was my cat. I don't even know if my cat had a name. I can't remember. But I remember the picture
            in my head. I remember what my cat looked like. And I'll remember her essence. I told myself that I would
            remember her. And I will.

            Which shoulder of mine did you lay your head upon. Which cheek of mine had you kissed. It seemed wrong of me
            to remember and it feels wrong for me to forget.

            It's funny how I don't really have a single phone number. None of them are constant phone numbers of mine.
        </div>
        <div class= "element element5"> I don't use a single one for more than 6 months at a stretch.

            I think I'm actually empty on the inside. I think that's the issue with why I feel out of tune. I was
            emptied of character somewhere along the line and now I'm empty. I display these emotions but it's all the
            outermost thinnest shell. I'm hollow on the inside. This is probably why I don't feel attached to anything
            in this world. Did I empty myself of feeling in order to move on? Didn't I pride myself on the philosophy of
            pure emotion? This is is kind of ironic. Will I come to accept this revelation somewhere down the line or
            will I feel the muscle fat and meat inside of me once again. Will I feel like my insides exist? Who knows
            lol

            My tea doesn't taste the same anymore. Kinda sounds like a metaphor lol</div>
        <div class= "element element6">

            I feel like I'm becoming dependent on coffee and I hate it. Fuck.

            I'm writing this now because I'm not really feeling any strong emotion. Most of what I've written previously
            has been the output of strong emotion which is truly enjoy. This entry however is just plain and sprouts
            from nothing. I think there's beauty in this too. Why should emotion trigger artistic response. Everybody
            has moments when they're not feeling anything and this is to appreciate that

            I've been feel extremely lovesick these past few weeks. Human intimacy triggers my want for more. I feel
            lonely I suppose. That's been my everlasting state for a while. I also. Feel really warm right now. Like Im
            being loved at this very moment, but I'm alone. Maybe it's the weed in my head and coffee in my hands but I
            feel really nice. Hopeful, yet a hint of sadness that makes me feel grateful for being alive

            I just had a breakdown. For no reason. I was feeling down the whole day. Again idk why. I was so happy with
            how my semester went and the people I've met in these past few months. But I just bawled me eyes out not
            even knowing why. I kept asking myself why I'm crying but I had no answer. Is this normal. I can't remember
            if this has happened before. I think it has. But I'm not sure. Wtf is wrong with me. I'm crying while
            writing this. I still don't know why

            Narration in a book is the same as music in a book's movie adaptation. </div>
        <div class= "element element7">

            Bombay feels like someone went and built a whole ass city in the center of a jungle in under a day and told
            all the residents of the jungle "this is your home now" and everyone was like "yeah cool".

            When sitting at the front of a class does one forget that the class behind them exists. The person sitting
            at the back however is constantly aware of the whole class

            If you destroy something made using child labor are you destroying all of their hardwork. Did they work for
            nothing

            If you were made of fire, you would be feeling cold every moment of your life. </div>
        <div class= "element element8">

            I just showed my friends a news article I got from this news app inshorts. The article wasn't at all
            relevant and I'm just really high so I thought showing them a random thing would be funny. The thing I
            realized is that they didn't understand the article at all. It read, "world cup's fastest hundred, biggest
            run chase came in same match." I could understand it because I was indian and had the basic understanding of
            cricket that comes with being indian. It's fascinating that they couldn't read and understand the same news
            article that I read and understood even though it was in proper English. It's because they have different
            backgrounds that's wild.
            </div>

        <div class= "element element9">I just woke up from a crazy ass dream. It's funny actually cause I don't even remember the dream. I just
            remember that it was a really cool journey and I was living a different life as a different person. I was in
            a different world. I was enjoying it. I think. What's crazy is. The only thing I remember was the last thing
            that happened. A familiar face and voice from the journey was speaking to me. It said ' and I'm sorry but
            this is how this is going to end '. And as soon as they said that, my alarm started to go off in the real
            world, and I woke up here. Fkn mad.

            So corona is happening. I'm living in a pandemic Bois. Everything feels so unreal. So surreal. Countries in
            fear. Borders closed. People in fear. Stores closed. I feel like all the displacement in my life has led to
            this climax. I'm being kicked out of my dorm. I was kicked out from loeb hall last year. But this time it's
            because the school is scared. Scared of this virus. As everyone should be im sure. But they've given us 4
            days to move out of this dorm. Never have I felt so displaced. So unwanted. This was a reminder that we're
            all living under the mercy of someone else. Someone more powerful. But more so than that, this 'crisis' has
            made me realize that I don't really belong anywhere. Should I go to India. Should I find an apartment in
            NYC. Should I go to Philly. Dubai isn't an option I suppose. I just do not know where I belong and where I
            should go. I'm an alien. To all places. What is my identity. What is my home.


            It's been a while. Idk if it was the dishes I was doing or the rain that was screaming through the mosquito
            net of the window next to me. There's supposed to be a cyclone tomorrow. Or today. I don't really know the
            difference anymore. Is that a bad thing? Who knows? I haven't written here in a really long time. Feels that
            way at least. Especially considering all the stuff that's happened to me since I last wrote.
            Corona is still happening. I'm in Bombay rn.</div>
        <div class= "element element10">At home with my family. It's weird. Everything that wasn't bombay feels like… a fever dream. It feels like
            I've just woken up into this reality. Everything feels off. But not too bad tbh. I'm not in a bad state
            right now. It was pretty bad when school was still on- online school lmao. I just lost all motivation to do
            anything. I haven't coded in so long, I wasn't learning anything. I felt useless and was being useless. I
            began to draw during classes. Put my video off, audio off, ipad on and was sketching. I've posted more than
            I ever have on my art page on instagram. Idek if that's an accomplishment. This period of my life feels like
            those scenes from movies where the main character enters a white room where they are supposed to confront
            all that they think is bad about themselves and only then can they be released back into reality. It's a
            struggle. But i also feel guilt. I have the privilege to have this struggle. Right now especially, more than
            ever, my privilege is being shoved in my face. Super cyclones, locust swarms, the biggest fucking migrant
            crisis and now some of the biggest riots the United States has ever seen. I saw a video of a policeman
            pulling a gun out on the crowd just around my old dorm. Shits unreal. There's struggle happening all around
            the world at this very moment and I'm here in my high rise apartment writing this on my phone. Everything
            feels just off. I haven't been outdoors ever since I landed. Idk if that's affected me at all tbh. I feel
            the same. It feels like yesterday that I landed in bombay but in realiy its been like 4 months. What the
            fuck. I feel my depersonalization syndrome knocking on my mind's door every other minute. But he's like my
            best friend now so it's chill. He's like my toxic friend who you know is toxic but you also care about.
            Lmao. I've just been drawing non stop. Part of me likes it. And part of me hates it. That's been my
            disposition off late. That duality. And this has been a long ass entry. Okay um. 2020 recap- Australian
            wildfires, climate change, indo pakistan cold war, us Afghanistan and Iraq??? War, world war three threats,
            a fucking pandemic, super cyclones in india, murder of george floyd causing the biggest riots in America,
            I'm sure there's more but I'm tired and don't feel like googling it.
            We're barely halfway through this year and it's been a fucking trip. I wanna smoke. </div>
